# Akhar-Awaz
Learning the English alphabet can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be. Akhar Awaaz is a first-of-its-kind interactive learning app designed specifically for Punjabi-speaking children. We bridge the gap between two languages by teaching English alphabet sounds using a relatable Punjabi phonetic guide.
