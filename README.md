Akhar Awaaz is a first-of-its-kind interactive learning app designed specifically for Punjabi-speaking children. We bridge the gap between two languages by teaching English alphabet sounds using a relatable Punjabi phonetic guide. Learning the English alphabet can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be.

Features
Interactive Learning: A dedicated "Learn" section allows children to navigate through all 26 English letters and their corresponding Punjabi phonetics using simple navigation arrows.

Alphabet Quiz: A fun, interactive quiz mode tests children's knowledge by presenting an English letter and asking them to choose the correct Punjabi phonetic sound from three options.

Active Recall: Incorrectly answered questions are reintroduced later in the quiz to reinforce learning and improve retention.

Visual Feedback: The app provides clear, immediate feedback. Correct answers turn the selection button green, and incorrect answers turn the selection button red while highlighting the correct choice in green.

Dual-Language Interface: All key instructions and buttons are displayed in both English and Punjabi to provide a supportive learning environment.

Simple & Gamified Design: The app features a bright, attractive user interface with engaging colors and bold typography designed to hold a child's attention.
